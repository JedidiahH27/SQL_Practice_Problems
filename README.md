# SQL Practice Problems
This repository contains my solutions to a variety of SQL practice problems sourced from platforms like StrataScratch, DataLemur, and LeetCode. All problems are solved using PostgreSQL.

The problems span a range of real-world scenarios and are designed to strengthen core SQL skills, including:

- Filtering and aggregation

- JOINs and subqueries

- Window functions

- CTEs (Common Table Expressions)

- Ranking and grouping logic
